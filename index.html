        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>css is used to style HTML elements which allows for creation of not only well-structured but also visually appealing website</li>
          <li>3 ways to style a webpage are inline css, internal css style sheet and external css style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline css are used for quick and permanent changes and are less flexible than internal and external because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>External css style sheet is the most common and preferred way as it allows developers to keep all their css rules in a seperate file which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Class attributes allows us to share a css rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.The class attribute can then be assigned to the element in the HTML enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the css rule.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable,one of the core feature of javascript, is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Using conditional statements as 'if' statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>Arrays are used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>The first item in an array has an index of 0 not 1.The indices or location identifiers will alweays be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop contains 3 important statements; The First determines the STARTING POINT for our loop, the second statement is the CONDITION - as long as the number in the variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. The final statement is what allows the array iterate over each item.</li>
          <LI>Placing /* Before and */ After the block of code is known as Commenting out a code. This makes the block of code inactive without deleting it</LI>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.They are reusable blocks of code that contains instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
