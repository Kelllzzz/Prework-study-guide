        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>css is used to style HTML elements which allows for creation of not only well-structured but also visually appealing website</li>
          <li>3 ways to style a webpage are inline css, internal css style sheet and external css style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline css are used for quick and permanent changes and are less flexible than internal and external because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>External css style sheet is the most common and preferred way as it allows developers to keep all their css rules in a seperate file which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Class attributes allows us to share a css rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.The class attribute can then be assigned to the element in the HTML enabling us to freely chosse which elements will be assigned the css rule.</li>
